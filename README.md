# Foods-API
Foods API is a simple RESTful API built with **FastAPI** to manage food items.   It supports full **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and allows exporting all food data as a **JSON file**.   This project demonstrates **basic data persistence** using a local JSON file and proper input validation with **Pydantic**.
